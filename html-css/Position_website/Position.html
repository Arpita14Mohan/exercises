      <h1><abbr>CSS</abbr> Positioning</h1>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
      <h2>What Is This?</h2>

      <p>This example page shows all the four types of positioning that are
      available in <abbr>CSS :</abbr></p>

      <ul>
        <li>static (content)</li>
        <li>relative (drop cap in block quotation)</li>
        <li>absolute (the sidebar to the right)</li>
        <li>fixed (header, footer, left-hand menu)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fixed and Absolute Positioning</h2>
      <p>Both the header (logo and page heading) and the footer (copyright
      statement) have fixed positioning, at the top and bottom of the screen,
      respectively. If you scroll down the page you will see that the content
      and the sidebar will scroll, but the header and footer will stay in place.
      </p>

      <p>The navigation menu on the left also has a fixed position, so it
      will remain in place when the page is scrolled. The sidebar to the right,
      on the other hand, is absolutely positioned and will scroll along with
      the content.</p>

      <h2>Relative Positioning</h2>

      <p>In order to show how relative positioning works, the block quotation
      below uses a floating <em>and</em> relatively positioned drop cap.
      By floating it to the left it we create a drop cap and by using relative
      positioning we can nudge it upward and to the left and create a cut-out
      effect.</p>
	

      <blockquote>
        <p><span>T</span>he containing block in which the root element lives is
        chosen by the user agent. (It could be related to the viewport.) This
        containing block is called the initial containing block.</p>
      </blockquote>
	
	  <blockquote>
        <p style="height:48px">The containing block in which the root element lives is
        chosen by the user agent. The containing block in which the root element lives is
        chosen by the user agent(It could be related to the viewport.) (It could be related to the viewport.)containing block containing a block is called the initial containing bloc <span id="rightFloat">K</span></p>
      	</blockquote>
      
      <h2>Z-Index</h2>

      <p>If you look at the page source you will see that I have set
      <code>z-index:1</code> for the header. Why?</p>

      <p>The header, sidebar, menu and footer are all positioned, and they
      occur in this order in the markup. They have the same containing block
	  which means they belong to the same stacking context.</p>

      <p>Without the z-index setting for the header, the sidebar will slide
      on top of the header as you scroll down the page.</p>

      <p>By increasing the z-index for the header I can put it in front of the
      sidebar, so that the latter will slide underneath the former as you
      scroll.</p>

      <p>I could also have achieved a similar effect in this case by setting
      <code>z-index:-1</code> for the sidebar.</p>

      </div>

    <div id="sidebar">
      <p>The sidebar is positioned absolutely at the right-hand edge of the
      page, so it will scroll with the main content.</p>
    </div>
