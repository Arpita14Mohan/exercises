See how the images here are both floated left and right of the browser screen,
this is how it would render on a browser if done. image floating enables you to
push an image in the right direction in flow with your text. in this example we've
placed four images for them to be displayed both left and right of the screen.
see the code above to learn more.
<p id ="clear">
<img src="images/logo.jpg"width="200" height="120" />
</p>
<p id="right">
<img src="images/logo.jpg" width="200" height="120" /></p>
To make this stand out correctly, we've added some random text after the images that
 has been floated. since all images are either floated left or right, you can see that
the text is in the middle of both sides of images and it wraps itself around it.
